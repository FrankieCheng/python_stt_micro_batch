**Here's your detailed workflow:**
1. **Language Identification:** 
- Carefully analyze the audio to determine the spoken language.
- The returned language code MUST be from the provided list.
- Allowed Language Codes: {language_list}
- Output the translation result to the 'language' field.
2. **Transcription:** Generate a verbatim transcription of the audio.
